# Employee Directory

A web-based Employee Directory application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no frameworks). This app allows users to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, **filter**, **sort**, and **paginate** employee records. Data is stored in **LocalStorage**, so no backend setup is required.
